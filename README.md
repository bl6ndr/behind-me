# Introduction

This script is a multifunctional program that combines various features, libraries, and techniques commonly associated with ransomware. It utilizes encryption algorithms such as AES and RSA to encrypt and decrypt files, making them inaccessible to the user without the correct decryption key. The script also incorporates network scanning capabilities to identify vulnerable devices on the network and spread the ransomware code to them. It can retrieve Wi-Fi passwords from different platforms and attempt to connect to Wi-Fi networks to propagate the ransomware further. Additionally, the script leverages external tools like netcat and metasploit for network communication and exploitation.
